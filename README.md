## Particle Setup

Install `particle-cli` from [their documentation](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli/photon/). Requires `npm` and `nodejs`, and some packages need you to `ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node` because Javascript is for bad people.

From there:

1. `particle login`
2. `particle setup`
3. Configure Particle core to your WiFi network.
